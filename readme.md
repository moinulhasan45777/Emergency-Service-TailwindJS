## Description
"Emergency Service Directory" is a fully responsive project for mobile and desktop screens created using HTML, Tailwind CSS & JavaScript. This project was a graded assignment for the [Complete Web Development Course](https://web.programming-hero.com/course-details) offered by Programming Hero. The project involved recreating a website provided on Figma while also incorporating a challenge section of my own which further strengthened my grasp of the technologies used. It's worth noting that the project received full marks just like my other ones, demonstrating the successful implementation of the required features, design and functionality.
